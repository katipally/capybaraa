# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.
Format loosely follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com).

## [Unreleased]

- **The ruleset is now lean, and so are the numbers.** The injected core was ~1,500 tokens of
  seven-pillar prose plus a badge-and-sign-off ceremony every turn, which made capybaraa tie a
  bare agent on output tokens and cost ~16% more. Rewrote it to ponytail size: the lean ladder
  plus five habits (ASK with an ASCII sketch, OPTIMAL, TERSE, CLEAN, SYNC), a safety floor, a
  one-glyph `🦫` badge, **no sign-off and no done-gate** (~440 tokens, a 70% cut). Capybaraa now
  spends **~10% fewer output tokens** and writes **~30% less code** than the bare agent, fully
  complete (3/3); cost is +5%, the small plugin tax even ponytail pays. Writeup:
  `benchmarks/results/2026-06-26-sonnet-lean.md`.
- **Benchmark dropped the clarify panel, added the peer arms.** The headline run is now four arms
  (baseline, caveman, ponytail, capybaraa) on clear build tasks, charted ponytail-style as percent
  of baseline for LOC, output tokens, cost, and time. caveman ships vendored (MIT) as a prompt arm;
  ponytail loads as a real plugin. `chart.py` is one grouped-bar panel; the CLARIFY panel is gone.
- **Synced the lean identity everywhere.** Rewrote `principles/build-instructions.js`,
  `references/principles.md`, all five skills (tags are now ask/lean/optimal/terse/clean/sync, the
  deferral ledger is removed), the manifests, the README, and the smoke test to the ladder-plus-five-habits
  model. The ASK behavior (questions plus ASCII on an ambiguous ticket) stays; it is just not the
  benchmarked headline anymore.

## [0.4.2] - 2026-06-26

- **Fresh, honest benchmark numbers.** Re-ran a small focused batch (4 tasks, n=3, clean,
  no rate-limit hits) to get defensible values. The README now claims what reproduces: on
  the CLARIFY judge capybaraa **1.0 vs baseline 0.0** (asks the spec-deciding questions by
  default), and **12-20% less code** on the feature tasks (star widget 29 vs 33, CSV export
  16 vs 20), both fully complete (3/3). Dropped the earlier headline -39% / "~238 lines"
  figures: real but the high end of run-to-run variance, not typical. The nine deterministic
  gates (100% both) carry over from the broader 0.4.0 run. Writeup:
  `benchmarks/results/2026-06-26-sonnet-0.4.2.md`; chart regenerated.
- **Claims rewritten for the reader.** Each benchmark result now spells out what it means for
  you (answer two questions now instead of deleting a wrong guess later; a couple dozen fewer
  lines to read, review, and own; leaner never means a dropped safety check), not just a
  percentage. `chart.py` now plots whatever task subset a run contains.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-06-25

- **CLARIFY reframed as an improvement layer, not a missing ability.** Claude already
  clarifies (plan mode, an obvious missing detail); capybaraa raises the *frequency* (ask
  more readily, even outside plan mode), the *depth* (the few questions that actually decide
  the build, each explained), and the *clarity* (ASCII on the options). Reworded in CORE,
  `references/principles.md`, both cards, and the README so nothing implies Claude won't ask.
- **Benchmark writeup corrected.** The "238-line SettingsManager" detail was wrong: checked
  against the actual run output, the bare agent invented the whole spec (theme, font size,
  six languages, notification toggles) and wrote ~238 lines unprompted, with no class by that
  name. Fixed in the README, changelog, results writeup, and the chart caption. The numbers
  (CLARIFY 1.5 vs 0.0, 6-50% leaner, 9/9 gates) were already accurate and re-verified.
- **Credit to ponytail.** Added a Credit section naming [ponytail](https://github.com/DietrichGebert/ponytail)
  by Dietrich Gebert as the origin of the lazy-senior-dev idea, the LEAN ladder, the
  always-on-via-hooks design, the `capybaraa:` deferral marker, and this README's shape.
- **Audit pass.** Swept the repo for AI-commentary comments, stale text, dead code, and
  pillar/command/version drift: none found.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-06-25

- **Debt merged into audit.** The standalone `/capybaraa-debt` skill is gone; its job -
  harvesting the `capybaraa:` deferral markers into a rot-risk ledger (no-trigger ones
  first) - is now a DEFERRALS section inside `/capybaraa-audit`. One repo-scan command
  instead of two. The `capybaraa:` marker convention itself is unchanged. Five slash
  commands now: `/capybaraa`, `-review`, `-audit`, `-sync`, `-help`.
- **ASCII on questions is now a hard rule, and broader.** The CLARIFY pillar no longer just
  suggests an ASCII sketch - *whenever capybaraa puts a question to the user* (clarify,
  choosing an approach, confirming a risky propagation), it draws the options as ASCII so
  the tradeoff is visible, and skips the sketch only for a genuinely shapeless choice (a
  pure yes/no, one free-text value), saying why in one line. The conscious gate still
  decides *whether* to ask; this rule governs *how*. Updated in CORE, `references/`, the
  cards, and the README, with a new smoke assert.
- **Ponytail removed everywhere.** Dropped every comparison to the ponytail plugin: the
  README benchmark section is now baseline-vs-capybaraa only, the agentic harness drops the
  `ponytail`/`caveman` arms (default arms are `baseline,capybaraa`), and the ponytail-era
  result writeups and the stale LOC chart are gone. (Historical CHANGELOG entries that
  record removing the old ponytail coupling are left as-is - they're release history.)
- **Benchmark covers all seven pillars, and we ran it.** Added deterministic,
  selftest-validated tasks for the three missing pillars: `optimal-members` (promote to a set
  vs O(n*m) list-membership), `economy-nofiller` (no comment lines outnumbering the code), and
  `sync-rename` (a rename reaches the comment, not just the symbol). Fixed two CLARIFY-task
  artifacts (an empty workspace, and a "only the code is measured" directive that punished
  asking). Ran it on Sonnet 4.6, 3 runs: capybaraa asks before coding (CLARIFY judge 1.5 vs
  baseline 0.0, where on a vague ticket the baseline invented the whole spec and wrote ~238 lines unprompted), builds
  the same complete feature 6-50% leaner, and never drops a deterministic gate (9/9 at 100%
  both arms). Writeup in `benchmarks/results/2026-06-25-sonnet-0.4.0.md`, chart regenerated by
  `benchmarks/agentic/chart.py`.
- **README restructured, with real numbers.** Same voice, refreshed substance: new before/after,
  five-command table, the ASCII rule in the pillar table, the measured results above with a
  two-panel chart, and a run-it-yourself block. No em-dashes or other AI-tell artifacts.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-06-26

- **One-shot release script.** `npm run release -- X.Y.Z` now bumps the version in all
  three files, runs the tests and a best-effort manifest validation, then commits, tags
  `vX.Y.Z`, pushes `main` and the tag, and creates the GitHub Release from the changelog
  section, all together. A tag can no longer land without its Release (the gap that left
  0.3.0 and 0.3.1 tagged but unreleased). It refuses to run off `main`, on an existing tag,
  or without a `## [X.Y.Z]` changelog section; `--dry-run` previews without changing
  anything. `RELEASING.md` is updated to this flow.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-06-25

- **SYNC is now the seventh pillar.** Keeping the docs, tests, comments, sibling code, and
  version strings in step with a change is promoted from a clause inside COMPLETE to a
  first-class pillar with its own `references/principles.md` section, review/audit `sync:`
  tag, and help-card row. "Six pillars" is now "seven pillars" everywhere. `/capybaraa-sync`
  (added in 0.3.0) is the on-demand sweep for it.
- **Benchmark graphs refreshed.** Removed the two stale Haiku SVGs
  (`benchmark-multiarm.svg`, `benchmark-gates.svg`) that showed the old two-mode build, and
  replaced them with one accurate chart (`benchmark-loc.svg`) built from the current
  single-mode Sonnet 4.6 run. The README "does it help" section is reworked to lead with
  current numbers; the earlier five-arm findings are kept as text, honestly labelled.
- **Consistency pass.** Audited and aligned every place the pillars and rules are stated
  (CORE, references, README, all skills, help card, manifests, tests) so they tell one
  consistent story.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-25

- **One mode, no dial.** `lean`/`deep` are gone. Capybaraa is now a single always-on
  mode whose depth adapts to the task: a trivial ask gets the rules and nothing else, a
  real feature or hard bug earns the full clarify-before-code treatment. State is just
  `on`/`off`. `/capybaraa on|off`; legacy flags/env (`deep`, `lean`, `medium`) map to
  `on` so existing installs keep working. Statusline shows `[CAPYBARAA]`, badge is
  `🦫 capybaraa` (no mode suffix).
- **Conscious token gate.** A new reflex in front of the six pillars: before any
  token-expensive move (deep exploration, spawning subagents, a full clarify ceremony,
  long output), check that the spend is proportional. Small task: just do it. Scope
  unclear and a wrong guess is costly: ask one sharp question first instead of bursting
  tokens. Resolves "have everything" vs "don't waste".
- **Fixed a real bug: substring command matching.** Deactivation and command parsing
  matched the phrase *anywhere* in a message, so a message that merely quoted "stop
  capybaraa" or "normal mode" silently turned it off. Commands now require a whole-message
  match (root-cause fix, with regression checks in the smoke test).
- **Pillars broadened beyond coding** (new projects, existing code, bug-clearing,
  research, ops, writing) and framed as the antidotes to how a stock agent fails, with
  sharper root-cause guidance (fix the shared cause once, not the one symptom path).
- **New `/capybaraa-debt` skill + `capybaraa:` marker convention.** Intentional
  simplifications get a `capybaraa:` comment naming the ceiling and upgrade trigger; the
  skill harvests them into a ledger and flags the no-trigger ones as highest rot risk.
- **Sync is part of done + new `/capybaraa-sync` skill.** The COMPLETE pillar now treats a
  change as unfinished until the docs, comments, tests, sibling code, and version strings
  that referenced the old shape are updated and the stale ones deleted (confirming before
  large or risky propagation). `/capybaraa-sync` runs that drift sweep across the whole
  repo on demand: lists each gap, confirms, then updates and removes stale.
- **Note on benchmarks.** The dated `benchmarks/results/*.md` files predate this change
  and still describe the `deep` arm; they record past runs and are left as-is. The
  harness (`benchmarks/prompts.js`, `benchmarks/agentic/run.py`) is updated to the single
  mode.

## [0.2.4] - 2026-06-25

- **Two modes instead of three levels.** `low`/`medium`/`high` are replaced by two
  modes chosen on the detail/token tradeoff: **`lean`** (minimum tokens: build tight,
  ask only what blocks correctness, skip ASCII unless it stops the wrong build) and
  **`deep`** *(default)* (full clarify-before-code, ASCII on the options, every edge case,
  complete-but-minimal code, strict done-gate). The six pillars hold in both; `lean`
  saves tokens, never validation or security. `/capybaraa lean|deep|off`, statusline shows
  `[CAPYBARAA]` (deep) or `[CAPYBARAA:LEAN]`. Default flips from `medium` to `deep`.
- **Visible signal in responses.** Capybaraa now opens substantive replies with a
  `🦫 capybaraa · <mode>` badge and closes non-trivial work with a one-line sign-off of
  what it did under the pillars, so you can always tell it is active and shaping the
  answer. One line each, the only ceremony it adds to how the agent talks.
- **README benchmark graphs.** Added two SVG charts
  (`assets/benchmark-multiarm.svg`, `assets/benchmark-gates.svg`) built from the existing
  five-arm Haiku 4.5 run: the clarify-vs-lean tradeoff and the gate scoreboard.
- **Dropped a dead dependency.** Removed the unused `playwright` dependency (never
  imported); the plugin now ships with zero runtime dependencies, only the Node stdlib.

## [0.2.3] - 2026-06-25

- **Reframed "plan mode" to behavior.** The injected principles, skills, help card,
  and README no longer tell the agent to "drop into plan mode" (a user-controlled mode
  it cannot reliably self-enter). They now say "clarify before you code" and note plan
  mode as the ideal venue when the user is in it.
- **Two-layer detail.** Added [`references/principles.md`](references/principles.md):
  per-pillar worked examples, situation rules, edge cases, and do/don't tables. The
  injected CORE stays terse and points at it on demand, so adherence improves without
  taxing every session.
- **New `/capybaraa-audit` skill.** Whole-repo scan against the six pillars (the
  diff-only `/capybaraa-review` has a repo-wide counterpart now). Lists findings ranked
  by impact, does not edit.
- **Logo.** README now leads with `assets/capybara_nobg.png` instead of an emoji.
- **Removed stray em-dashes** from the docs, honoring the project's own plain-language
  rule.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-06-25

- **Claude Code only.** Dropped Cursor / Copilot / OpenCode support and the npm
  CLI that installed them (`bin/`, `installer/`). Those tools have no hook or
  skill system, so they only ever got static rules text; the project is now a
  focused native plugin. Removed the npm publish workflow, releases ship from
  this repo via the marketplace pin. See [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md).

## [0.2.1] - 2026-06-25

- Renamed to **capybaraa** across the board (plugin, slash commands `/capybaraa`,
  skills, flag file, statusline badge). Plain `capybara` was already taken, so the
  doubled `a` is the consistent brand.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-24

- Capybaraa is now fully independent. Removed the ponytail detection and the
  LEAN-pillar dedupe; all six pillars ship every session regardless of what else
  is installed.
- CLARIFY now routes real work into Claude Code's plan mode instead of just hoping
  the model asks questions. The injected text and skills point at plan mode with
  curated ASCII questions.
- New `/capybaraa-review` skill: reviews the current diff against the six pillars
  and lists findings, one line each. Does not edit files.
- Added a reproducible benchmark harness under `benchmarks/` (tasks, correctness
  gate, LOC/cost/latency scoring) so impact can be measured, not asserted.
- Rewrote the principle text and docs in plain language. No em-dashes, no shipped
  tagline.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-24

Initial release.

- Six pillars injected proportionally: **clarify, lean, optimal, economy,
  complete, hygiene**.
- Levels `low` / `medium` / `high` / `off` (default `medium`), switched with
  `/capybaraa <level>` or "stop capybaraa".
- Skills: `/capybaraa` (level switch) and `/capybaraa-help`.
- SessionStart / UserPromptSubmit / SubagentStart hooks; statusline badge.
- Coexistence with ponytail (dropped the overlapping LEAN pillar when ponytail was
  active). Removed in 0.2.0.
- `npx capybaraa init|doctor|update|uninstall` wizard installing rules
  bridges into Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, and OpenCode.
