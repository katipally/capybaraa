# Publishing runbook

Three independent channels. Do them in any order; each needs *your* accounts.

```
 1. GitHub  → makes the Claude Code plugin installable from your repo  (done by push)
 2. npm     → makes `npx @katipally/capybara` work for everyone        (GitHub Action)
 3. Catalog → lists you in the official Claude Code marketplace        (optional)
```

## 1. GitHub (already pushed)

The repo is public at `https://github.com/katipally/capybara`, so Claude Code
users can already install straight from it — no approval needed:

```
/plugin marketplace add katipally/capybara
/plugin install capybara@capybara
```

When you change anything, commit and push to `main`. The marketplace pin follows
`ref: "main"` in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`.

## 2. npm (via GitHub Actions, OIDC — no secrets)

One-time setup:

1. Create the package owner on npm: `npm login`, then a first manual publish is
   **not** required — OIDC can do the very first publish too, but npm must know the
   package name belongs to you. Easiest path: `npm publish --access public` once
   from your machine to claim `@katipally/capybara`, **or** create the package via
   the npm website.
2. On npm: **@katipally/capybara → Settings → Trusted Publisher → Add GitHub
   Actions**, repo `katipally/capybara`, workflow `publish.yml`.

Every release after that:

```bash
# bump version in package.json + CHANGELOG.md, commit, then:
git tag v0.1.0
git push origin v0.1.0      # publish.yml runs: npm test → npm publish --provenance
```

The Action mints a short-lived token via OIDC — there is no `NPM_TOKEN` to manage.
Needs npm ≥ 11.5.1 (Node 22 in the workflow provides it).

## 3. Official Claude Code marketplace (optional)

Listing in the community catalog gets you discovery, not new capability — direct
repo install already works.

1. Validate first (the review pipeline runs the same check):
   ```bash
   claude plugin validate .
   claude plugin validate . --strict
   ```
2. Submit:
   - Individual authors → <https://platform.claude.com/plugins/submit>
   - Org owners → <https://claude.ai/admin-settings/directory/submissions/plugins/new>
3. Automated safety screening runs; approved plugins are pinned to a commit SHA in
   `anthropics/claude-plugins-community` and synced nightly. Allow ~1–2 days.

Note: the npm package name is scoped (`@katipally/capybara`) because plain
`capybara` was taken. If you'd rather have a short unscoped `npx capybara-cc`,
rename `name` in `package.json` and the `npx` lines in the README before step 2.
