# Capybaraa Audit

Scan the entire repository against capybaraa's rules and report what a calm senior dev
would cut or fix. This is the whole-repo counterpart to `/capybaraa-review` (which only
looks at the current diff). It is a quality pass, not a correctness audit, and not a
security audit: for runtime bugs use `/code-review`, for exploits use `/security-review`.

Detailed guidance: `references/principles.md`.

## How to run it

1. Map the repo first: source layout, entry points, the dependency manifest. Skip
   vendored code, lockfiles, build output, and `.git`.
2. Read the real source. For every problem, emit ONE line:

   `path:line: <tag> <what's wrong>. <the fix>.`

3. Rank the findings by impact, biggest first: the abstraction nobody uses, the
   dependency a few lines would replace, the dead module, before the stray comment.
4. Group nothing, pad nothing. End with a one-line verdict naming the top one to three
   things to delete or fix.

## Tags (one per rule, same vocabulary as /capybaraa-review)

- `ask:` a spec was guessed where nothing said it: a flag, a branch, a config key
  built on an assumption. Name the assumption.
- `lean:` something that does not need to exist: an abstraction with one caller, a
  config for a constant, a dependency for what stdlib or a few lines already do, dead
  flexibility kept "for later". Name what to delete or inline.
- `optimal:` wrong data structure or needless O(n^2) on a hot path. Name the better one.
- `terse:` filler comments that restate the code, dead prose, docs that lie about the
  code. Name the lines to cut.
- `clean:` dead code, an orphaned old version left beside its replacement, a stale
  comment, or an unsanitized input at a trust boundary. Name what to remove or guard.
- `sync:` a doc, README, comment, test, or version string that describes a shape the code
  no longer has: a renamed symbol, a removed flag, a lagging version. Name what to update
  or delete so the repo stops lying about itself.

## Output shape

```
src/cache/CacheManager.js:1: lean: 180-line cache class wraps one Map with no eviction. Replace with a Map, add eviction when it's actually needed.
src/util/dates.js:1: lean: moment imported for one format() call. Use Intl.DateTimeFormat, drop the dependency.
src/legacy/parseV1.js:1: clean: whole module dead since v2 parser landed, no callers. Delete it.
src/api/handler.js:55: clean: req.body.id passed straight into the query, no validation. Guard it at the boundary.
src/report/build.js:30: optimal: findUser called inside the row loop, O(n^2). Build a Map of users once.
README.md:12: sync: documents a --verbose flag removed in v3, no longer parsed. Delete the line.

verdict: delete CacheManager and parseV1, drop moment.
```

## Boundaries

Lists findings only, does not edit files. Over-engineering, mess, dead code, and docs out
of sync are in scope. Correctness bugs, security exploits, and performance profiling are
not, that is what `/code-review` and `/security-review` are for. If you spot a real
security hole while reading, flag it in one line and tell the user to run
`/security-review`. Do not fix it silently.
