# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.
Format loosely follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com).

## [0.2.3] - 2026-06-25

- **Reframed "plan mode" to behavior.** The injected principles, skills, help card,
  and README no longer tell the agent to "drop into plan mode" (a user-controlled mode
  it cannot reliably self-enter). They now say "clarify before you code" and note plan
  mode as the ideal venue when the user is in it.
- **Two-layer detail.** Added [`references/principles.md`](references/principles.md):
  per-pillar worked examples, situation rules, edge cases, and do/don't tables. The
  injected CORE stays terse and points at it on demand, so adherence improves without
  taxing every session.
- **New `/capybaraa-audit` skill.** Whole-repo scan against the six pillars (the
  diff-only `/capybaraa-review` has a repo-wide counterpart now). Lists findings ranked
  by impact, does not edit.
- **Logo.** README now leads with `assets/capybara_nobg.png` instead of an emoji.
- **Removed stray em-dashes** from the docs, honoring the project's own plain-language
  rule.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-06-25

- **Claude Code only.** Dropped Cursor / Copilot / OpenCode support and the npm
  CLI that installed them (`bin/`, `installer/`). Those tools have no hook or
  skill system, so they only ever got static rules text; the project is now a
  focused native plugin. Removed the npm publish workflow, releases ship from
  this repo via the marketplace pin. See [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md).

## [0.2.1] - 2026-06-25

- Renamed to **capybaraa** across the board (plugin, slash commands `/capybaraa`,
  skills, flag file, statusline badge). Plain `capybara` was already taken, so the
  doubled `a` is the consistent brand.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-24

- Capybaraa is now fully independent. Removed the ponytail detection and the
  LEAN-pillar dedupe; all six pillars ship every session regardless of what else
  is installed.
- CLARIFY now routes real work into Claude Code's plan mode instead of just hoping
  the model asks questions. The injected text and skills point at plan mode with
  curated ASCII questions.
- New `/capybaraa-review` skill: reviews the current diff against the six pillars
  and lists findings, one line each. Does not edit files.
- Added a reproducible benchmark harness under `benchmarks/` (tasks, correctness
  gate, LOC/cost/latency scoring) so impact can be measured, not asserted.
- Rewrote the principle text and docs in plain language. No em-dashes, no shipped
  tagline.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-24

Initial release.

- Six pillars injected proportionally: **clarify, lean, optimal, economy,
  complete, hygiene**.
- Levels `low` / `medium` / `high` / `off` (default `medium`), switched with
  `/capybaraa <level>` or "stop capybaraa".
- Skills: `/capybaraa` (level switch) and `/capybaraa-help`.
- SessionStart / UserPromptSubmit / SubagentStart hooks; statusline badge.
- Coexistence with ponytail (dropped the overlapping LEAN pillar when ponytail was
  active). Removed in 0.2.0.
- `npx capybaraa init|doctor|update|uninstall` wizard installing rules
  bridges into Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, and OpenCode.
