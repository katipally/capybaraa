# Capybaraa Review

Review the current change (the staged/unstaged diff, or the files the user names)
against the six pillars. This is a quality pass, not a correctness audit: it hunts
the things a calm senior dev would flag in review, not runtime bugs. For correctness
bugs use `/code-review`.

## How to run it

1. Get the diff: `git diff` plus `git diff --staged` (or read the files the user points at).
2. Read each changed hunk. For every problem, emit ONE line:

   `path:line: <tag> <what's wrong>. <the fix>.`

3. Group nothing, pad nothing. If a hunk is clean, say so and move on.
4. End with a one-line verdict: ship it, or fix the flagged lines first.

## Tags (one per pillar)

- `clarify:` the spec was guessed where the code or the request did not say. Name the
  assumption that should have been a question.
- `lean:` something that does not need to exist: an abstraction with one caller, a
  config for a constant, a dependency for what stdlib or a few lines already do, dead
  flexibility "for later". Name what to delete or inline.
- `optimal:` wrong data structure or needless O(n^2) on a hot path. Name the better one.
- `economy:` filler comments that restate the code, dead prose, a comment that explains
  the obvious. Name the lines to cut.
- `complete:` a leftover TODO, a symptom patch over the real cause, or non-trivial logic
  shipped with no test/build/lint run. Name the missing check or the real fix.
- `hygiene:` the old version left next to the new, a stale comment, dead code the change
  orphaned, or an unsanitized input at a trust boundary. Name what to remove or guard.

## Output shape

```
src/auth.js:42: lean: AuthFactory wraps one constructor. Inline it, call the class directly.
src/auth.js:88: complete: TODO "handle expiry" left in. Either handle it or open an issue and link it.
src/parse.js:15: optimal: nested .find in a loop, O(n^2). Build a Map once, look up in O(1).
src/parse.js:60: hygiene: old parseLine() still here, dead since line 15 replaced it. Delete it.
verdict: fix the four lines above, then ship.
```

## Boundaries

Lists findings only, does not edit files. Over-engineering, mess, and unfinished work
are in scope. Correctness bugs, security exploits, and performance profiling are not,
that is what `/code-review` and `/security-review` are for. If you spot a real security
hole while reading, flag it in one line and tell the user to run `/security-review`,
do not fix it silently.
